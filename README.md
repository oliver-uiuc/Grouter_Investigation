# GINI-Router-Investigation

Gini is a toolkit developed at Advanced Networking Research Laboratory at McGill University for creating virtual micro Internets for teaching and learning computer networks. 

We (with Mr. GU Nianzhen and Ms. Dai Yixin) did an investigation on GINI router forwarding path based on the existing document and code to improve GINI router performance in terms of packet processing rate, QoS, vertically scaling and horizontal scaling. Check the report and codes for the details.
