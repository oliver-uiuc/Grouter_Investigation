.SH DESCRIPTION

The 
.B openflow
command displays information related to the OpenFlow switch.

The
.B entry
sub-command displays OpenFlow flow table entries, while the
.B stats entry
displays statistics for OpenFlow flow table entries. You can either specify an entry index or
.B all
for all entries. Note that OpenFlow flow table entries are zero-indexed.

The
.B port
sub-command displays OpenFlow ports, while the
.B stats port
displays statistics for OpenFlow ports. You can either specify a port index or
.B all
for all ports. Note that OpenFlow flow table entries are one-indexed.

The
.B stats table
sub-comamnd displays global flow table statistics, while the
.B stats desc
sub-command displays general switch information.

For each of the above sub-commands, see the relevant OpenFlow struct definitions in openflow.h to see the different kind of information provided for each.

This command can also be used to force the switch to reconnect to the controller by using the
.B reconnect
sub-command. This is useful if you have just loaded a POX module and need to trigger its initialization.

This command can only be used when gRouter is launched in OpenFlow mode. gRouter is in OpenFlow mode if and only if it is connected to an OpenFlow controller.

.SH EXAMPLES

To print the OpenFlow flow table entry at index 3, use the following command:
.br
openflow entry 3

To print out the corresponding statistics for that entry, use the following command:
.br
openflow stats entry 3

To print out all OpenFlow flow table entries, use the following command:
.br
openflow entry all

To print out the corresponding statistics for those entries, use the following command:
.br
openflow stats entry all
